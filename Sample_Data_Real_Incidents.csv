We are now having discussions what is the best way to get to SLES15.

Should the os-guys do a fresh installation or should they perform an inplace upgrade from SLES12 to SLES15?

SAP provides a SAP note ...

2578899 - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15: Installation Note

with section ..

Upgrading SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15

stating that an upgrade is supported:

For upgrading SUSE Linux Enterprise Server see the Upgrade Guide for your targeted Service Pack: https://documentation.suse.com/

The document includes the upgrade form SLES 12 to SLES 15 as well as upgrading from one Service Pack to another.

But on the other hand, following the link to SUSE documentation ...

https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP3/html/SLES-all/cha-upgrade-paths.html#sec-upgrade-vs-fresh-install

it is stated that SUSE recommends fresh installation in most scenarios.

There is the following section in the upgrade guide:

1.1 Upgrading versus fresh installation Report Documentation Bug #Edit source

Upgrades between two major releases of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server are supported by SUSE.

Whether it is better to upgrade or perform a fresh installation depends on your specific scenario.

While upgrades involve less work, fresh installations ensure you benefit from all the new features of a release such as disk layout changes,

specific filesystem features, and other improvements.

To get the most out of your system, SUSE therefore recommends fresh installations in most scenarios.

Are the features which are mentioned (disk layout changes, specific filesystem features, and other improvements) used by SAP so that it would make sense to do a fresh installation?

As a SAP basis guy I personally would prefer an inplace upgrade if there is not anything against it.

Are there any concerns?

What is your recommendation?

Do you maybe have already successfully upgraded SLES12 to SLES15?",3-Medium,Resolved,Apr-25-2022,"How about taking a VM snapshot (non-prd first), doing an in-place upgrade, see how it works. If not successful, roll back to the snapshot and do a fresh installation later.

How about booting from PXE, then you can decide what you boot at boot time?

How about using a boot disk, exchanging it to SLES15? This way you can do the switch in almost zero time.

I agree with starting to test on a snapshot or backup of an existing SLES12 LPAR in non-prod.

It is my opinion that an in-place upgrade is a good approach if your OS admins do not plan to make any changes to the partitioning layout and sizes or filesystem types used for the OS.

I would consider disabling any automatic starting of HANA, unmounting the HANA filesystems and commenting the automatic mounting of the HANA filesytems during reboot. Temporarily disabling these will get them out of the way of reboots during the offline OS upgrade.

Be sure to understand the supported upgrade paths to 15 SP3 because your post did not mention what SLES 12 SP level you are currently at. Follow all of the steps in the offline upgrade including the post-upgrade checks.

I would manually do the first LPAR but consider looking at automation tools if you have many LPARs to upgrade. SUSE has a very good tool for centralized Linux systems management.",,,,

I have not come across any documentation that describes how to actually turn features on or off. Is there any way to turn features on or off at runtime (like through a /proc/ variable)? Are features something to be configured using make menuconfig when compiling a kernel? Or is the only way to modify the source code of a virtio device file and add/remove features there (like modifying this enum in vhost/vhost.h)?",4-Low,Resolved,Jul-01-2021,"The latest Virtio Committee specification, v1.2, describes the virtio feature bits here. Specifically:

Each virtio device offers all the features it understands. During device initialization, the driver reads this and tells the device the subset that it accepts. The only way to renegotiate is to reset the device.

This allows for forwards and backwards compatibility: if the device is enhanced with a new feature bit, older drivers will not write that feature bit back to the device. Similarly, if a driver is enhanced with a feature that the device doesn’t support, it see the new feature is not offered.

So the answer is: you need to decide at initialization time which feature(s) you want your device to support and prepare to do the feature negotiation properly per the Device Initialization section.",,,,
INC0020,Linux_OS,"ARM64 SVE registers not preserved when issuing a syscall, why does Linux discard SVE registers with sve_user_discard()?","n the Linux 5.10 AArch64 syscall.c source code, there is a function sve_user_discard(), which can make the SVE registers' [max:128] bits being zeroed. Here's the code.

I cannot understand the usage of this function. Can anyone explain it to me?

I got a bug when running a SVE program and finally found the root cause is the sve_user_discard(). This function makes the SVE registers in userspace only remain bits [127:0], which makes my program not work as expected.",4-Low,Resolved,Jul-05-2021,"After digging around a bit, it turns out that all I needed to do was RTFM :'). This behavior is intended and documented.

The Linux ARM64 Syscall ABI explicitly resets bits above 127 of the Z registers, all bits of the P registers and the FFR register on syscall entry. Therefore, there is no way to preserve full SVE state on ARM64 Linux between system calls. If your code uses SVE, you will need to split it up so that SVE is only used between syscalls. Even with a vector length of 128 bits, you would still lose the values of P0..P15 and FFR upon syscall entry.

Here's a quote from kernel documentation on SVE confirming this behavior. I highlighted the interesting parts in bold:

3. System call behaviour
On syscall, V0..V31 are preserved (as without SVE). Thus, bits [127:0] of Z0..Z31 are preserved. All other bits of Z0..Z31, and all of P0..P15 and FFR become unspecified on return from a syscall.

The SVE registers are not used to pass arguments to or receive results from any syscall.

In practice the affected registers/bits will be preserved or will be replaced with zeros on return from a syscall, but userspace should not make assumptions about this. The kernel behaviour may vary on a case-by-case basis.",,,,

From this Draft C11 Standard:

7.20 Integer types <stdint.h>
1      The header <stdint.h> declares sets of integer types having specified widths, and defines corresponding sets of macros. It also defines macros that specify limits of integer types corresponding to types defined in other standard headers.

Using this header, you have access to types like int64_t and uint8_t; from the same Draft Standard section (bold italic emphasis in §3 mine):

7.20.1.1 Exact-width integer types
1      The typedef name intN_t designates a signed integer type with width N, no padding bits, and a two’s complement representation. Thus, int8_t denotes such a signed integer type with a width of exactly 8 bits.

2      The typedef name uintN_t designates an unsigned integer type with width N, no padding bits, Thus, uint24_t denotes such an unsigned integer type with a width of exactly 24 bits.

3      These types are optional. However, if an implementation provides integer types with widths of 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits, no padding bits, and (for the signed types) that have a two’s complement representation, it shall define the corresponding typedef names.

or, Seccomp (short for secure computing mode) allows you to apply fine-grained restrictions on the syscalls that a process can use.

While seccomp wasn't initially designed for dynamic modification of syscalls, it can be utilized to restrict and control syscall behavior for targeted processes.

You mentioned you'd rather not use LD_PRELOAD, but it's worth noting that this technique allows you to intercept calls to specific functions, including syscalls, by preloading a shared library.

I have implemented the communication following this link and my user space callback is getting called. However I am getting segmentation fault when parsing the message. Instead of using nl_socket_modify_cb to setup the callback handler, I have used libev ev_io_init to setup a handler whenever it becomes ready to READ. In the sample code below I have omitted the error handling since, my callback function is getting called when kernel sends a multicast message. So everything seems to work till that point.",4-Low,Resolved,Jul-07-2021,"I followed the below link and able to parse the message although that example is not complete in terms of parsing multiple attributes but still some starting point.

INC0028,LINUX_KERNEL,How can I stop emmc recovery?,"I have a prebuilt Linux kernel 4.19. I can't build a fresh one. I can mount an emmc partition read-only with no issue. I have trouble mounting partitions read and write. It reports ""running CQE recovery""

I am thinking of killing the recovery function when it starts after I mount partition -o rw. I am suspecting the function is in core.c My idea would be to set the MMC_CQE_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT as a kernel command line parameter. But I don't know which parameter does that if it exists. Or I could run a function that stops the recovery. I could maybe create a binary that calls the function mmc_cqe_request_done(mmc, mrq) from cqhci-core.c but I don't have access to mmc, mrq parameters since im not making a kernel driver or maybe I can create the parameters somehow from a block device itself after booting the kernel and running mknod(). Which of these is possible?

I am not trying to patch any kernel source I want to know if it's possible to stop running QCE recovery by creating a binary I can run or use a kernel parameter that can stop qce recovery.",3-Medium,Resolved,Jul-07-2021,"When I asked the question I had no idea device tree blobs could be modified. My goto solution was the impression I could run code in userspace to stop the recovery. I found a simpler solution. Which has nothing to do with writing code.

The problem was I needed to stop the command queue and I had no idea how to do it and didn't know where it was being enabled in the first place.

It turns out the device tree has mediatek,cqhci property which isn't supported well by the kernel. It seems my kernel sources probably had it enabled by patching their kernel sources since it wasn't available for mainline MEDIATEK mmc

/ {
    mmc@11230000 {
        compatible = ""mediatek,mt6768-mmc"";
        mediatek,cqhci;
    };
};
So I had to modify the device tree file with fdtput.

fdtput -d /path/to/fdt /mmc@11230000 ""mediatek,cqhci""
Steps

I dumped the device tree blob from the boot.img
I Binwalked through the blob to get the pure flattened device tree
Deleted the command queue enabler property from the blob with fdtput",,,,
