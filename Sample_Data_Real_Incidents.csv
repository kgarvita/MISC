INC0001,SAP_ECC_BW,SAP on Linux Suse -vs- Oracle Linux -vs- Linux Red Hat,"We are planning on replatforming our ECC and BW SAP environments based on some version of Linux. We are running Oracle on the backend.

I am curious if anyone out there would know why we might use Linux Suse over Oracle Linux and vice-versa. Is there a technical argument to be made for using Linux Red Hat above all else?

Are the technical advantages for one over the other? Are more SAP shops using one more than the other?",3-Medium,Resolved,Jun-06-2021,"I’m referring to the aspect of FC where the storage array vendor will have a simple list of supported attached operating systems--this will probably include at least Red Hat and Suse nowadays--and then a more detailed matrix listing operating system, attached server vendor, model and FC adapter model, etc. and then the server hardware vendor will also have a list of supported storage arrays and then a more detailed matrix for the same things OS, server, HBA. Getting your combination to appear in both the storage and server vendors matrix may be most likely with Red Hat, followed by Suse and Oracle Linux."
INC0002,SAP_ECC,Linux Redhat or SUSE,"Could anyone tell me what are the diffences between running SAP ECC on Linux Redhat or SUSE?

are there any pros/cons about running one or another?

Same doubt for S4HANA",3-Medium,Resolved,Jul-15-2019,"I am happy to provide some input and newer information. Most SUSE vs. RHEL related information is outdated (<2018) as a lot of new features, products and additions had been added since then by Red Hat.

A good summary of supported and certified versions is: https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/ATopics/Technical+Resources+for+SAP+HANA+and+Data+Hub+on+Red+Hat

Apart form Linux, there are additonal supported or certified products to virtualize, to integrate with and to run e.g. SAP Business Apps. It's also a lot of Automation for initial Deployments as well as Day2 operations. Most is done through Ansible.

Compared to SLES, Red Hat Linux (RHEL) for SAP Solutions subscriptions include supported Ansible roles, as well as smart Management, HA etc. This works cloud agnostic in cloud and on prem. Red Hat is adding more Day2 Automation support into their products.

See https://redhat-sap.github.io/sap-workshops/#/ for some good examples of Automation. Also, there is a SAP Linux Lab initiative on that topics: https://sap-linuxlab.github.io/

If you would like to get a detailed technical overview of the current RHEL releases 8 and 9, look here:
https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3082481

RHEL is certified to run SAP in all major hyperscalers, private cloud and on prem on x86 and IBM Power. For IBM Cloud, RHEL is the exclusive option."

https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-upgrade-paths.html

Cross-architecture upgrades, such as upgrading from a 32-bit version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server to the 64-bit version, or upgrading from big endian to little endian are not supported!

Specifically, SLE 11 on POWER (big endian) to SLE 15 SP4 on POWER (new: little endian!) is not supported.

Also, since SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 is 64-bit only, upgrades from any 32-bit SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 systems to SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 and later are not supported.

To make a cross-architecture upgrade, you need to perform a new installation."
INC0006,SAP_S4HANA,Upgrading to SLES15 versus fresh installation,"we operate the SAP systems for some companies.

Some of our customers are currently running S/4HANA 1909 on ppc64le with SLES12.

You know it is a prerequisite to have SLES15 installed when you want to upgrade to S/4HANA 2021.

We are now having discussions what is the best way to get to SLES15.

Should the os-guys do a fresh installation or should they perform an inplace upgrade from SLES12 to SLES15?

SAP provides a SAP note ...

2578899 - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15: Installation Note

with section ..

Upgrading SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15

stating that an upgrade is supported:

For upgrading SUSE Linux Enterprise Server see the Upgrade Guide for your targeted Service Pack: https://documentation.suse.com/

The document includes the upgrade form SLES 12 to SLES 15 as well as upgrading from one Service Pack to another.

But on the other hand, following the link to SUSE documentation ...

https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP3/html/SLES-all/cha-upgrade-paths.html#sec-upgrade-vs-fresh-install

it is stated that SUSE recommends fresh installation in most scenarios.

There is the following section in the upgrade guide:

1.1 Upgrading versus fresh installation Report Documentation Bug #Edit source

Upgrades between two major releases of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server are supported by SUSE.

Whether it is better to upgrade or perform a fresh installation depends on your specific scenario.

While upgrades involve less work, fresh installations ensure you benefit from all the new features of a release such as disk layout changes,

specific filesystem features, and other improvements.

To get the most out of your system, SUSE therefore recommends fresh installations in most scenarios.

Are the features which are mentioned (disk layout changes, specific filesystem features, and other improvements) used by SAP so that it would make sense to do a fresh installation?

As a SAP basis guy I personally would prefer an inplace upgrade if there is not anything against it.

Are there any concerns?

What is your recommendation?

Do you maybe have already successfully upgraded SLES12 to SLES15?",3-Medium,Resolved,Apr-25-2022,"How about taking a VM snapshot (non-prd first), doing an in-place upgrade, see how it works. If not successful, roll back to the snapshot and do a fresh installation later.

How about booting from PXE, then you can decide what you boot at boot time?

How about using a boot disk, exchanging it to SLES15? This way you can do the switch in almost zero time.

I agree with starting to test on a snapshot or backup of an existing SLES12 LPAR in non-prod.

It is my opinion that an in-place upgrade is a good approach if your OS admins do not plan to make any changes to the partitioning layout and sizes or filesystem types used for the OS.

I would consider disabling any automatic starting of HANA, unmounting the HANA filesystems and commenting the automatic mounting of the HANA filesytems during reboot. Temporarily disabling these will get them out of the way of reboots during the offline OS upgrade.

Be sure to understand the supported upgrade paths to 15 SP3 because your post did not mention what SLES 12 SP level you are currently at. Follow all of the steps in the offline upgrade including the post-upgrade checks.

I would manually do the first LPAR but consider looking at automation tools if you have many LPARs to upgrade. SUSE has a very good tool for centralized Linux systems management."
